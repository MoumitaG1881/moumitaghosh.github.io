Hello there! Thank you for visiting my profile. I am Moumita Ghosh and I have majored in Statistics and Data Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I am also a bachelor and master degree holder in Engineering./

My research interest includes predictive modelling, statistical inference, LLMs, and optimization. Irrespective of any fields, math always does wonder! I do love math especially calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. I further my interest in the field of causal inference and the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. I believe in building solutions that will ultimately seve for mankind./
